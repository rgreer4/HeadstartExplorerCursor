It's a cursor.

Windows doesn't like big cursors.  I don't know how to load it without software like CursorFX: https://www.stardock.com/products/cursorfx/ ($5, 30 day trial...)

In CursorFX:
1. My Cursors
2. Create Cursor
3. Standard Select
4. Import Graphics
5. (pick the image in this repo)
6. It may to animate, change Frames to "0" to fix it.
7. Above the inner window, click File->Save and Apply
8. Enjoy
